Title: Zipf Extended Distributions
Version: 0.7.0
Author: Ariel Duarte-López and Marta Pérez-Casany
Maintainer: Ariel Duarte-López <aduarte@ac.upc.edu>
Description: Implementation of three extensions of the Zipf distribution: the Marshall-Olkin 
  Extended Zipf (MOEZipf), the Zipf-Poisson Extreme (Zipf-PE) and the 
  Zipf-Poisson Stopped Sum (Zipf-PSS) distributions. 
  In log-log scale, the two first extensions allow for 
  top-concavity and top-convexity while the third one only allows for top-concavity. 
  All the extensions maintain the linearity associated with the Zipf model in the tail.
