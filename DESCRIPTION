Title: Zipf Extended Distributions
Version: 0.5.0
Author: Ariel Duarte-López and Marta Pérez-Casany
Maintainer: Ariel Duarte-López <aduarte@ac.upc.edu>
Description: Implementation of the Marshall-Olkin Extended Zipf (MOEZipf), 
  the Zipf-Poisson Extreme (Zipf-PE) and the Zipf-Poisson Stopped Sum (Zipf-PSS) distributions. 
  These distributions are a two-parameter extensions of the widely used Zipf model. The two 
  first extrension allow concavity (convexity) at the first values of the distributions while 
  the Zipf-PSS allows convexity. All the extensions maintain the linearity, associated with 
  the Zipf model, in the tail. This can be appreciated by plotting the probabilities 
  in log-log scale.
