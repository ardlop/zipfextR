Title: Zipf Extended Distributions
Version: 0.6.0
Author: Ariel Duarte-López and Marta Pérez-Casany
Maintainer: Ariel Duarte-López <aduarte@ac.upc.edu>
Description: Implementation of three extensions of the Zipf distribution: the Marshall-Olkin 
  Extended Zipf (MOEZipf), the Zipf-Poisson Extreme (Zipf-PE) and the 
  Zipf-Poisson Stopped Sum (Zipf-PSS) distributions. The two first extensions allow for 
  top-concavity (top-convexity) while the third one only allows for concavity. 
  In log-log scale, all the extensions maintain the linearity, associated with the 
  Zipf model, in the tail. This can be appreciated by plotting the probabilities in 
  log-log scale.
